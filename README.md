# üß† Command Classifier with Logistic Regression and MLflow Tracking

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and register a **command classification model** using **Logistic Regression** (or other classic ML models) and **MLflow** for experiment tracking and model lifecycle management.

The system is designed to classify computer commands (e.g., ‚Äúturn off the PC‚Äù, ‚Äúopen Chrome‚Äù, ‚Äúplay music at 6‚Äù) based on their intent ‚Äî either **immediate actions** or **scheduled actions** ‚Äî by combining text processing, model training, and deployment tracking.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project was developed as a practical exercise for **Machine Learning model tracking and deployment** using **MLflow**.  
It focuses on building a complete ML pipeline, from preprocessing to model registration and production deployment.

### Key Learning Objectives

1. Train a **Logistic Regression model** using example data (`scikit-learn`).
2. Log model **hyperparameters** (`C`, `regularization`, `solver`) and **metrics** (`accuracy`, `f1-score`) with MLflow.

# Hyperparameters

</div>

# Metrics
<div style="text-align: center;">
   <img src="parameters.png" alt="Metrics"  width="50%" height="50%" >
</div>

3. Use `mlflow.sklearn.log_model()` to **save and version** the trained model.
# code
<div style="text-align: center;">
   <img src="register.png" alt="register_code"  width="50%" height="50%" >
</div>

4. Register the model in the **MLflow Model Registry** with a unique name.

# Model
<div style="text-align: center;">
   <img src="models.png" alt="models"  width="50%" height="50%" >
</div>

5. Promote the model across lifecycle stages:
   ```
   None ‚Üí Staging ‚Üí Production
   ```

   
# Stage transition

   <img src="stage.png" alt="stage"  width="50%" height="50%" >
</div>

# Stage transition in MLFLOW UI
<div style="text-align: center;">
   <img src="stage_mlflow.png" alt="stage_mlflow"  width="50%" height="50%" >
</div>

6. Observe model versions, descriptions, and performance metrics in the MLflow UI.

# versions with descriptions
<div style="text-align: center;">
   <img src="versions.png" alt="stage_mlflow"  width="50%" height="50%" >

## ‚öôÔ∏è Main Components

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Handling (`Data.py`)
- Loads and validates the dataset from CSV.
- Cleans text (lowercase, removes accents/symbols).
- Encodes labels using `LabelEncoder`.
- Combines columns `command` and `intent` into a unified label.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Pipeline (`Model.py`)
- Uses a **TF-IDF Vectorizer** to transform text into numerical features.
- Trains a **Logistic Regression** (or Naive Bayes) model for classification.
- Splits the data into training/testing sets and calculates:
  - `accuracy_score`
  - `f1_score`
  - training time
- Provides a `.test()` method for inference with new commands.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ MLflow Integration (`main.py`)
- Starts an MLflow run and logs:
  - Parameters (`C`, `solver`, regularization type)
  - Metrics (`accuracy`, `f1_score`, inference time`)
  - Artifacts (dataset, model pipeline)
- Registers the trained model in the **Model Registry**.
- Promotes it to **Production** automatically.

## üìä Example Metrics Logged in MLflow

| Metric          | Description |
|-----------------|--------------|
| **accuracy**     | Model accuracy on test data |
| **f1-score**     | Weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall |
| **train_time**   | Duration of the training phase |
| **prediction_proba** | Model‚Äôs confidence in its prediction |

---

## üß± Example Workflow

1. **Run the main script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. **MLflow will:**
   - Start a new run
   - Train the model
   - Log parameters and metrics
   - Register the model in the Model Registry
   - Promote it to ‚ÄúProduction‚Äù

3. **Check results in the MLflow UI:**
   ```bash
   mlflow ui
   ```
   Navigate to: `http://localhost:5000`

4. You will see:
   - Model versioning
   - Training metrics and parameters
   - Production-ready registered model

## üèÅ Expected Result

After running this project, you will have a **versioned and production-ready ML model** in MLflow, complete with:
- Registered hyperparameters and metrics  
- Dataset artifact  
- Full model lifecycle management  

This serves as a solid template for building, tracking, and deploying classic ML models in production environments.

### üì¶ Example Registry Stages

| Stage | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **None** | Model freshly trained, not yet reviewed |
| **Staging** | Under testing or validation |
| **Production** | Active model used in production |
| **Archived** | Old or deprecated versions |
